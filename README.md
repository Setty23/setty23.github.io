Description:
A software tool that serves as a database of chemical properties and a calculator for performing various chemical calculations commonly used in chemical engineering. Professionals and students will be able to use these tools.  This tool will provide quick access to essential chemical data and facilitate calculations related to thermodynamics, kinetics, and process design.

Key Features:

Chemical Property Database: The software will include a database of common chemical properties such as molecular weight, density, specific heat capacity, enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy for a wide range of chemical compounds.
Search and Retrieval: Users can search for chemical compounds by name, formula, or CAS number to retrieve their properties from the database.
Process Design Parameters: The software will provide tools for calculating process design parameters such as residence time, conversion, yield, and selectivity for chemical reactors and separation processes.
Unit Conversion: Users can convert between different units commonly used in chemical engineering calculations, such as temperature, pressure, concentration, and flow rate.
Error Handling: The tool will include error handling mechanisms to validate input data and alert users to any inconsistencies or invalid inputs.
User-Friendly Interface: The user interface will be intuitive and easy to use, with clear instructions and error messages to guide users through the process.
